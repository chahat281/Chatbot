      "Nature of Operations\n",
      "Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August \n",
      "2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became \n",
      "the successor issuer to Google.\n",
      "We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \n",
      "enterprise customers with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales \n",
      "of other products and services, such as fees received for consumer subscription-based products, apps and in-app \n",
      "purchases, and devices.\n",
      "Basis of Consolidation\n",
      "The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \n",
      "under the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n",
      "Use of Estimates\n",
      "Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and \n",
      "assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. \n",
      "Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our \n",

      "of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among \n",
      "others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, \n",
      "and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n",
      "In January 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment and \n",
      "adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from four years to six years and the estimated useful life of certain \n",
      "network equipment from five years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal \n",
      "year 2023. Based on the carrying value of servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2022, and those \n",
      "placed in service during the year ended December 31, 2023, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in \n",

      "diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n",
      "Revenue Recognition\n",
      "Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and \n",

      "when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\n",
      "For ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on \n",
      "a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed \n",

      "Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n",
      "Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate \n",
